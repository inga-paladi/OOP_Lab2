Lab 2
In this laboratory work I have done a simulation of a restaurant .
The main class is Restaurant, every Restaurant has a Manager and a Chef, then for a restaurant to work we have waiters that have some tables to serve. Custumers will place a order, will have some drinks. After they are done they will want the bill. Sometimes they have to get the change. Thats how we need the cashier, wich will compute how much is the change, and if there is. At last the Customer will give a feedback. And this project goes, for each costumer.
